# Weather App

![Alt text](/assets/mock-up.png "Screenshot of weather app website")

## Description

This weather app was created to find weather conditions for the current and next 5 days. I learned about using the fetch functions to use APIs in projects. I also learned about local storage and how to save it to a webpage.
## Usage

Enter a city name into the text box and click the search button. Click on the city names saved in the search history to pull information for previous cities searched.

## Credits

Received help from Tutor Jose Lopez and LA Beau Fortier.
